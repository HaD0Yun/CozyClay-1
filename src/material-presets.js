/**
 * Material presets: named surface looks for sculpt parts (`material`, `finish`)
 * and plain primitives (`object.material`, `object.finish`). Pure data and the
 * record rules, no three.js, so the recipe reader, the scene record and Node
 * tests share one list; material-look.js turns an entry into a material.
 *
 * A record keeps only the names. `color` stays the base tint ("#c24a3b" with
 * wood is red-painted wood), and a colour left at the blockout grey takes the
 * preset's own (brick with no colour draws brick red). `finish` replaces the
 * preset's roughness: chrome is metal + gloss, frosted glass is glass + matte.
 * Clay with no finish is exactly the look every prop wore before presets.
 *
 * An entry (every field optional): roughness, metalness, color (its natural
 * tint), physical (MeshPhysicalMaterial fields), env (reflection strength on
 * a stage with no environment of its own), and a pattern with its tile in
 * metres, the axis its grain runs along (up: the part's own y; long: its
 * longest side; hang: its most upright side, skipping a slab's thickness),
 * albedo contrast, bump depth in metres, roughness variation and a mask
 * colour (brick mortar).
